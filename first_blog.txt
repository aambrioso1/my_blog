This is a simple blog based on an example found here Flask-Blogging.

It is basically the quick start example shown in the Flask-Blogging documentation. The app runs on a Linux virtually machine, Ubuntu 18.04, hosted by Digital Ocean. The application uses a uWSGI backend server and Nginx as the front-end proxy server.

My code for the application can be on my GitHub page here My Blog.

I would like to build it up by adding proper login features and giving it a nicer look using the Bootstrap CSS framework.
